// Bakes the commit being deployed into the served HTML as
// <meta name="build-commit" content="...">, so a post-deploy check can ask a
// static build what it is running. Vercel sets VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA at build
// time for git-connected deploys, which requires "Enable access to System
// Environment Variables" in the Vercel project settings; GIT_COMMIT_SHA is a
// platform-neutral override. Neither is set locally, which is what "unknown"
// means -- not an error.
//
// index.html rather than a separate /version.json on purpose: index.html is the
// document whose staleness is the actual failure, because it names the
// content-hashed bundles. A version.json can be served fresh while index.html
// is stale, which would let the check pass on a stale site.
